# Project: Titanic Survival Exploration
---
## Objective
#### The goal of this project is to create decision functions to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger's features. The decision function will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until at least 80% of the passengers outcomes in the data are accurately predicted.
